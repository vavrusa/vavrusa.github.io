I'm a software developer. I've been seeking challenges since I was a child poking the electrical sockets. That didn't last me for a long time, so I fell in love with systems programming. From designing the architecture, through development, to maintaining and community interaction.

When I'm not working, you can find me sipping on coffee or running around the nearby hills. Or both. I love endurance sports, classic rock, [I've cycled quite a bit](http://www.crazyguyonabike.com/directory/?user=zerolycra), oh and don't get me started about board games. Anyway, nobody cares about that, I get it.
