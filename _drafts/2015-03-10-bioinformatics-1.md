## Gentle introduction to Biology for programmers

I have started tinkering with the software at the age of fourteen, and while I wasn't particulary good at it, I was **blown away** how one can create things out of thin air. Dynamic web pages were the thing, so I got a book about PHP3 and made a CMS. I was into computer games as well, and when a one well-known MMORPG *(totally not World of Warcraft)* came out, I wanted to play. I wanted to play so bad, but I didn't have the money, so I started working on an open-source server instead. There was something compelling about a world that almost felt alive, it was a software I **wanted** to do so much, that I've learned C++ because of it.

Programming software is a discipline that requires critical thinking combined with language skills and plain old engineering.
