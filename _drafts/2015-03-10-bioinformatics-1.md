## Practical Biology for software developers

I have started tinkering with the software at the age of fourteen, and while I wasn't particulary good at it, I was **astonished** by how one can create things out of a thin air. Dynamic web pages were the thing, so I got a book about PHP3 and made a CMS. I was into computer games as well, and when a one well-known MMORPG *(totally not World of Warcraft)* came out, I wanted to play. I wanted to play so bad, but I didn't have the cash, so I started working on an open-source server instead. There was something compelling about a world that almost felt alive, it was a software I **wanted** to do so much, that I've learned C++ because of it. Why?

Producing "code" is a discipline that requires critical thinking combined with language skills and plain old engineering. The language part sets it apart from other engineering disciplines like construction or electric engineering. We often say: "I'm a C guy" or "I'm a Clojure ninja", but why is the dialect we speak on the front page more often than what we can do with the language? Computer languages, just like natural languages, differ in expressiveness, number of speakers, idioms and trends.
But all the languages have one thing in common - they are always translated to a language that computers can understand, a machine code. As this is essentially a one-way process, the computer languages do not have to encode colour, emotions nor homonyms. While everybody on Earth can understand at least one meatbag language, 
speaking a computer language is difficult because it requires one to adopt a computer mindset.

### The language of living things

An organism is, depending on who do you ask, a system of autonomous units called *[cells][cell-theory]* which in some way promote reproduction or some other method of survival. The key thing is that they form a *semi-closed* system, that means they're not ignorant of what's going outside and they can interact with each other.
Compare this to a function with a state, or an object in computer languages.
